            <h2>Why did this site come into being?</h2>
            <p>I wanted someday to provide my experiences as an audio / audio gear lover. I discovered my passion for audio equipment in 2014. I decided that there is a lot to talk about in this field, and so I would have my take as well. I've had the pleasure of owning a range of equipment that, giving me that unique experience as an audiophile that I want to share. I want to share excitement that comes with being able to experience the greatness of music and sound. This website is my way of logging reports on my perspective on a variety of topics, a way to share my experience in an incredible hobby.</p>

            <p>You'll get an honest review from me each time as I try to delve into the nuances of gear. I want to bring you along on my journey, because I live for the euphoria that can be experienced when listening to music, and I hope to convey that excitement to visitors.</p>

            <h2>So what exactly type of sound do you prefer?</h2>
            <p>I'm a big fan of soundstage, bass, and dynamics in sound. In all though, I'm in search, of nothing in particular, and it's really a path of discovery for me.</p>
