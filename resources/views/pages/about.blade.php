        <h2>Why did this site come into being?</h2>
        <p>I've always loved music, but I discovered Hi-Fi in 2012. I decided that since I enjoyed collecting equipment, I should also review them. 
            All of my reviews comes from my having had the pleasure of owning a range of equipment gives me a unique experience as an
            audiophile. This website is to share the excitement that comes with being able to experience the
            the variety of sounds from gear. I will log reports on a variety of
            topics to share my experience in this incredible hobby.</p>

        <p>I live for the euphoria that can be experienced when listening to music, the gear is just a plus which can enhance the delivery. 
            I hope to convey the excitement I have for Hi-Fi to visitors.</p>

        <h2>So what exactly type of sound do you prefer?</h2>
        <p>I'm a big fan of soundstage, bass, and dynamics in sound. In all though, I'm in search, of nothing in
            particular, and it's really a path of discovery for me.</p>
